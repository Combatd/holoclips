# Holoclips

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.0.2.

A single page web application for watching virtual idol related video clips.


## Component Design
I took a responsive static design html template and moved it into the Angular application. The next step would be to make it functional. These functions should be broken up into smaller steps.

* User
  * Login
  * Registration
  * Authentication
* Videos
  * Upload
  * Manage
  * View

I should work on the User system work, so that users can upload videos. I will need a few things.

* User Interface
* Form Validation
* Database
* State Management

* Layout of User Interface (UI)
  * Navigation Component
  * Modal Component
  * Login/Register Components
  * Tabs Component

## Angular commands

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.


Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.


Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).


Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
